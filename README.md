# GBControl


### DLL Menu for Ground Branch









### Features:
* Zoom FOV
* Shoulder Swap (Third Person)
* Different Camera Modes (Both in Co-Op & Lone Wolf)
* etc.



### Notes:
* Only works for DX11 currently (DX12 soon)
* Works for both Steam + SteamRIP versions.
* If the menu doesn't work, it most likely means the game has been updated and will need an update here too!

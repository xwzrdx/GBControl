# GBControl


### DLL Menu for [Ground Branch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/16900/GROUND_BRANCH/) by me & [0xb7d](https://github.com/0xB7D)






### How To Use:

* Download the DLL from [here](https://github.com/xwzrdx/GBControl/releases/tag/v1.0)
* Inject ``GBControl.dll`` using an injector
* Press ``Insert`` (Ins) to open & close the menu.





### Features:
* Zoom FOV
* Shoulder Swap (Third Person)
* First Person ADS (Third Person)
* Different Camera Modes (Both in Co-Op & Lone Wolf)
* etc.



### Notes:
* Only works for DX11 currently (DX12 soon)
* Works for both Steam + SteamRIP versions.
* If the menu doesn't work, it most likely means the game has been updated and will need an update here too!
* If you want to support what I do, feel free to [buy me a coffee!](https://buymeacoffee.com/wzard)
